# Image-Generator

This is a temporary Readme file. 

Image-Generator generates one or more images to a folder. 

The program allows customizing the image dimensions, the background color, the gradient color (and amount),
the file format (PNG, JPG, or BMP) and filename/directory. 

The option to add text (with customize font, color, size, etc) to the image is also available, 
with the ability to iterate if generating multiple images.

This program was written as a birthday gift to my father, as he manually makes images for buttons in his program. 
Image-Generator was meant to automate that process.

TO-DO:
  - Make proper readme file, with small tutorial on how to use program.
  - Re-write program using JavaFX, as it is better at handling dynamic UI. Also because learning is fun.
  - Update documentation in code. Comments exist, but some were written quickly and thus lack some depth.
